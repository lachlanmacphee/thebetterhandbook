# Monash Handbook Scraper

A TypeScript version of the Monash University handbook scraper, loosely based on [Sai's Go implementation](https://github.com/saikumarmk/monash-handbook-scraper).

## Credits

Shoutout to Sai for the original Go implementation. You can read the blog post about Sai's journey scraping the Monash Handbook [here](https://www.saikumarmk.com/universe-of-units/).
