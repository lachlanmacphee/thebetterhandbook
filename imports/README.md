# Overview

This directory contains all of the universities that are currently supported by TBH and the methods required to import units from their handbooks, APIs, etc.

## Usage

All imports are automatically run during seeding of the database. If you would like unit data, please use TBH's built in Unit API, as I intend for this to be a simple, accessible abstraction over the complexities of pulling unit data directly from University sites. See `bruno/` for examples. An API key can be generated on your `Profile` page once you log in to TBH.
